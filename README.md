# Q-Learning for Trading
Advanced Machine Learning – Lab 2

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains the work carried out for **Lab 2 of the Advanced Machine Learning course**.
The goal of this project is to apply **Q-Learning**, a reinforcement learning algorithm, to a simplified
**trading environment** in order to study agent behavior, learning dynamics, and performance.

The project is implemented and documented using a Jupyter Notebook.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand and implement **Q-Learning**
- Define states, actions, and reward functions in a trading context
- Train a reinforcement learning agent
- Analyze learning behavior and results
- Visualize performance metrics

---

## 🧠 Methodology
The project relies on **reinforcement learning**, where an agent interacts with an environment
and learns an optimal policy by maximizing cumulative rewards.

Key components:
- State space definition
- Action space (e.g., buy, sell, hold)
- Reward function based on trading outcomes
- Q-table updates using the Bellman equation
- Exploration vs exploitation strategy (ε-greedy)
